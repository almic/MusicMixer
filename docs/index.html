            For the best experience, use the latest version of Chrome.
            <br>
            Firefox doesn't "yet" support a core Web Audio API necessary for changing audio parameters on-the-fly.
            <br>
            This means volume, panning, playback rate, etc., cannot be modified effectively.
            <br>
            I have no plans to support Firefox's tardiness. It's been over 7 years, come on!
