/**
 * HRTF Panner that wraps two PannerNodes so they can be interpolated during updates.
 * Supposedly, the one included with Web Audio APIs are "not of the best quality" and I'm all about quality.
 *
 * The inspiration of this implementation comes from <https://github.com/twoz/hrtf-panner-js>, by Tomasz Woźniak.
 * I have not duplicated enough code to really say this contains a substantial portion, and this project is
 * already under the MIT license, so I'm sure giving his name is more than enough.
 *
 * How this works:
 *   - Split stereo input into left and right channels
 *   - Apply a lowpass filter to each channel, keep these frequencies for last step
 *   - Apply a highpass filter to each channel, spatializing with the panner node
 *   - Merge output of panner node with incoming low frequencies, send to output
 *
 * This means that low frequencies will not be spatialized, because:
 *     "Those are in their nature non-directional: hearing a deep bass coming
 *      only from one direction is very unnatural to hear." - T. Woźniak
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Implement custom HRTF from
 *   <https://codeandsound.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/implementing-binaural-hrtf-panner-node-with-web-audio-api/>.
 *
 * - Using this database:
 *   <https://3d3a.princeton.edu/3d3a-lab-head-related-transfer-function-database>
